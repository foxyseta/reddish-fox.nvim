# redish.vim

A Lua rewrite of [Niko Humalam√§ki](https://github.com/aparaatti/)'s
["Redish" Nvim colorscheme](https://github.com/aparaatti/redish.vim).

Some edits were made:

- the background color is now always transparent. This means that
  the terminal background color is used;
- color columns are now visible. This lets you see which lines of the buffer
  exceed the column number recommended maximum.
